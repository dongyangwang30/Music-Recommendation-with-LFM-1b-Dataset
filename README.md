# Music-Recommendation-with-LFM-1b-Dataset

In this project, we describe our design for several recommendation systems that help recommend music to users based on their personal background, such as gender, age, country, similar users, etc. The purpose is to utilize the recommendation systems such that the users can obtain music recommendations that best fit their tastes. Our models include collaborative filtering, demographic filtering, factorization machine, as well as hybrid filtering. We apply a 90-10 train-test split approach on the dataset and evaluate the models performances based on precision, recall, and the F-1 score. We find that across different number of neighbors, the factorization machine method has the best performance.
